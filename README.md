Why is my github not more bussy? 
During learning at dev academy we programed every day and would practice pair programming so my commits were on another person's account.
Why is there only one dark patch? 
We had final projects on that week and on Friday found that our program was majorly flawed and I spent a lot of time overhauling and committed 40 times and made my graph a bit out of whack.
