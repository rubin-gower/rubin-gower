# Rubin Gower
Welcome to my github! I'm currently working on a url shortener thats pinned below as well as my personal portfolio [website](http://rubin.net.nz). lots of old projects are computer games and can't really be on github as there HUGE files so they will be on my website. 


If you like what i do or looking to collaborate on any projects or ideas so get in contact with me at rubinsemails@gmail.com

Why is my github not more bussy? 
During learning at dev academy we programed every day and would practice pair programming so my commits were on another person's account.
Why is there only one dark patch? 
We had final projects on that week and on Friday found that our program was majorly flawed and I spent a lot of time overhauling and committed 40 times and made my graph a bit out of whack.
